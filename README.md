###Important Notes:

 + Starting new branch `dev` as our development branch, instead of master, please check out [this link](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). From now on, the main development should always be in this branch and the master branch should always contain the stable code, and other branches may be added.

 + Please update your django to the newest version 1.7
